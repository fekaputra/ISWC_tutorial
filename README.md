# Knowledge Graph & Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Repository

This repository provides a structured learning path for building Knowledge Graphs (KG) and Graph RAG systems using Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced graph-based techniques. It is divided into sessions, each focusing on different stages of the KG and RAG creation and fine-tuning process.

## Repository Structure

- **[Session 1 - KG Creation with LLMs](./session-1)**: This session focuses on using LLMs for creating knowledge graphs.
- **[Session 2 - Basic Graph RAG](./session-2)**: Introduces basic concepts of Graph RAG, setting the foundation for more advanced methods.
- **[Session 3 - Advanced Graph RAG](./session-3)**: Delves into advanced techniques and optimizations for Graph RAG.
- **[Session 4 - Fine Tuning](./session-4)**: Covers methods for fine-tuning models to improve RAG performance.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and clone the repository.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Git** installed. You can check by running:
```bash
git --version
```
Run the following command to clone the repository:
```
https://github.com/kellm-fit/ISWC_tutorial.git
```

## Running the Repository

You have two options for running this repository:

### 1. Google Colab
- Upload the repository to Google Colab to leverage GPU resources.
- Google Colab offers free GPU access, which can significantly speed up training and computation-heavy tasks.

### 2. Local Machine
- Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed so you can run the notebooks locally.
- Additionally, install GPU-compatible libraries (e.g., CUDA and cuDNN.

### 3. OpenAI API Key
- You need an OpenAI API Key. For the ISWC 2024 Tutorial, we will share the key in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aoYihC6g0atDJDq7-UieDHIpJvBcvFQ-o2UPuukwGQA/edit?usp=sharing).
