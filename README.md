# Knowledge Graph & Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Repository

This repository provides a structured learning path for building Knowledge Graphs (KG) and Graph RAG systems using Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced graph-based techniques. It is divided into sessions, each focusing on different stages of the KG and RAG creation and fine-tuning process. 

## Repository Structure

- **[Dataset](./dataset)**: Contains data files used across the sessions.
- **[Session 1 - KG Creation with LLMs](./session-1)**: This session focuses on using LLMs for creating knowledge graphs.
- **[Session 2 - Basic Graph RAG](./session-2)**: Introduces basic concepts of Graph RAG, setting the foundation for more advanced methods.
- **[Session 3 - Advanced Graph RAG](./session-3)**: Delves into advanced techniques and optimizations for Graph RAG.
- **[Session 4 - Fine Tuning](./session-4)**: Covers methods for fine-tuning models to improve RAG performance.
